# Open-Edu Architecture

Version: 0.1.0

Status: Draft

---

# Purpose

This document defines the technical architecture of the Open-Edu Framework.

While the Framework Specification defines **what the system must do**, this document defines **how the system is implemented** using the approved technology stack.

The architecture prioritizes:

- Accessibility by default
- AI-agent friendliness
- Local-first development
- Extensibility
- Observability
- Long-term maintainability

# Package Architecture

Educational experiences are distributed as portable packages.

```text
my-package/

package.json
workflow.json
rewards.json

nodes/
assets/
widgets/
```

The runtime must never require package compilation.

Packages remain:

- Human readable
- AI generatable
- Git friendly
- Platform independent

---

# Schema Layer

## Technology

```text
Zod
```

Zod serves as the single source of truth.

---

## Responsibilities

Generate:

- Runtime validation
- TypeScript types
- JSON Schema
- AI agent contracts

---

## Example

```typescript
const PackageSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
  version: z.string(),
  author: z.string(),
  entry: z.string(),
});
```

Generated artifacts:

```text
package.schema.json
Package.ts
Validation functions
```

---

# Workflow Engine

## Technology

```text
XState
```

The workflow engine is implemented as a deterministic state machine.

---

## Purpose

Controls:

- Navigation
- Progression
- Remediation loops
- Adaptive routing

---

## Flow

```text
Lesson
   │
   ▼
Quiz
   │
 ┌─┴──┐
 │    │
Pass Fail
 │    │
 ▼    ▼
Done Lesson
```

---

## Compilation Pipeline

```text
workflow.json
       │
       ▼
Workflow Parser
       │
       ▼
XState Machine
       │
       ▼
Runtime Execution
```

---

# Content Rendering Pipeline

## Markdown Engine

Technology:

```text
remark
rehype
unist
mdast
```

---

## Rendering Flow

```text
Markdown
   │
   ▼
AST
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Accessible React Components
```

---

## Benefits

Supports future:

- Reading analytics
- AI-assisted review
- Semantic enrichment
- Accessibility validation

---

# Runtime Renderer

## Technology

```text
React
TypeScript
```

Responsibilities:

- Node rendering
- Widget loading
- Progress tracking
- Accessibility integration

The renderer must remain stateless whenever possible.

Business logic belongs to:

- Workflow Engine
- Telemetry Engine
- Accessibility Engine

---

# Accessibility Engine

## Technology

```text
React Aria
axe-core
```

Accessibility is a core subsystem.

Not a plugin.

Not optional.

---

## Responsibilities

### Focus Management

Controls:

- Tab order
- Focus restoration
- Widget boundaries

---

### Keyboard Navigation

Supports:

```text
Tab
Shift + Tab
Enter
Space
Arrow Keys
Escape
```

---

### Screen Readers

Automatically generates:

- Labels
- Landmarks
- Roles
- Descriptions

---

### Validation

Development mode continuously runs:

```text
axe-core
```

Accessibility violations surface immediately.

---

# Internationalization

## Technology

```text
React Context
Intl APIs
```

The i18n package provides locale-aware translation and formatting.

---

## Responsibilities

### Translation Management

Controls:

- Namespace-based dictionary lookup
- Fallback to default locale
- Key interpolation with mustache syntax
- Missing key detection

---

### Locale Detection

Supports:

- English (en)
- Hindi (hi)
- Odia (or)

---

### React Integration

Provides:

- I18nProvider context wrapper
- useTranslation hook
- LanguageSwitcher component

---

### Formatting

Wraps:

```text
Intl.DateTimeFormat
Intl.NumberFormat
```

Locale-aware date, number, percent, and currency formatting.

---

# Widget Architecture

## Purpose

Allows specialized learning interactions without modifying the runtime.

Examples:

- Coding sandboxes
- Fraction sliders
- Simulations
- Interactive diagrams
- Music notation

---

## Widget Loading

Phase 1:

```text
NPM Package Widgets
```

Examples:

```text
@open-edu/widget-code-editor
@open-edu/widget-fraction-slider
```

---

## Future

Phase 2:

```text
Module Federation
```

Enables remote widget loading.

---

## Widget Lifecycle

```text

```

---

# Telemetry Architecture

## Technology

```text
RxJS
```

All learner interactions are modeled as event streams.

---

## Event Sources

Examples:

```text
Node Opened
Node Completed
Quiz Answered
Hint Triggered
Widget Interaction
Workflow Transition
```

---

## Flow

```text
Runtime
   │
   ▼
RxJS Event Stream
   │
   ▼
JSONL Persistence
   │
   ▼
Analytics
```

---

# Storage Layer

## MVP Storage

```text
JSONL
```

Location:

```text
.edu/telemetry.jsonl
```

---

## Why JSONL

Benefits:

- Append only
- Human readable
- Stream friendly
- Easy debugging

---

## Future Analytics

Technology:

```text
DuckDB
```

Used for:

- Telemetry analysis
- Learning analytics
- Curriculum observability

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM telemetry
WHERE event = 'quiz_failed';
```

---

# Reward Broker

## Purpose

Separates learning content from incentives.

---

## Event Flow

```text
Telemetry Event
       │
       ▼
Reward Broker
       │
       ▼
External Action
```

---

## Supported Actions

```json
{
  "action": "badge.award"
}
```

### Webhook

```json
{
  "action": "webhook"
}
```

### Script

# Architectural Principles

1. Accessibility before features.
2. Content before UI.
3. Schemas before implementation.
4. Telemetry before analytics.
5. Local-first before cloud.
6. AI-native before manual tooling.
7. Extensibility without framework complexity.

---

# Architecture Goal

To provide a lightweight, accessible, AI-native educational runtime capable of executing portable learning experiences while remaining simple enough for a single developer, educator, or AI agent to understand, extend, and deploy.
