# Image Label

**Widget ID:** `science.image-label` | **Domain:** science | **Status:** experimental

> Tap regions of an image to identify and learn about them.

## What it does

The Image Label widget shows an image with tappable regions. When students tap a region, they see its name and description. It works like an interactive exploration tool — great for planetariums, maps, and detailed diagrams.

## When to use this widget

- Interactive exploration of labeled images
- Solar system and astronomy activities
- Museum-style exhibit exploration
- Teaching visual identification skills

## Setting it up

1. Add an Exercise node to your lesson
2. Set the widget to "science.image-label"
3. Provide an image with alt text
4. Define clickable regions with x/y positions, titles, and descriptions
5. Optionally add hints for guided exploration

## Tips

- Use images with clearly defined, non-overlapping regions
- Keep region descriptions concise — 1-2 sentences
- Position regions carefully to cover the right part of the image
- Add tooltips to hint at what students will discover
