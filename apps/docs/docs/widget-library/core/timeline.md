# Timeline

**Widget ID:** `core.timeline` | **Domain:** core | **Status:** experimental

> Display events in chronological order on an interactive timeline.

## What it does

The Timeline widget arranges events along a visual timeline. Students can observe events in order or interactively arrange them. It supports horizontal, vertical, and compact layouts with optional dates, images, and descriptions.

## When to use this widget

- Teaching historical sequences and chronology
- Showing life cycles and growth stages
- Displaying project milestones or steps
- Visualizing process timelines in science

## Setting it up

1. Add an Exercise node to your lesson
2. Set the widget to "core.timeline"
3. Define your events — each needs an id and title
4. Optionally add dates, descriptions, icons, and images
5. Choose a layout: horizontal, vertical, or compact

  "widget": "core.timeline",
  "config": {
    "title": "The Water Cycle",
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "evap",
        "title": "Evaporation",
        "icon": "☀️",

## Tips

- Use clear, descriptive event titles
- Add emoji icons to make events visually distinct
- Keep descriptions short — 1 sentence or less
- For interactive mode, make sure the correct order is unambiguous
