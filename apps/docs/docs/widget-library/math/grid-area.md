# Grid Area

**Widget ID:** `math.grid-area` | **Domain:** math | **Status:** stable

> Calculate area by counting and highlighting squares on a grid.

## What it does

The Grid Area widget shows a rectangular grid where students count or highlight squares to understand area. Students can click individual cells, see the total count, and compare areas of different shapes.

## When to use this widget

- Introducing the concept of area
- Teaching that area = rows × columns
- Comparing areas of different shapes
- Distinguishing area from perimeter

## Setting it up

1. Add an Exercise node to your lesson
2. Set the widget to "math.grid-area"
3. Set the number of rows and columns
4. Choose area mode for square counting
5. Set maxHighlights to limit how many cells can be selected

## Configuration fields

| Field           | Type    | Required | Description                                                  |

| `maxHighlights` | number  | No       | Maximum number of cells a student can highlight.             |
| `description`   | string  | No       | Instructions for the student.                                |
| `showCount`     | boolean | No       | Show a running count of highlighted cells. Defaults to true. |
| `interactive`   | boolean | No       | When false, shows a pre-filled grid. Defaults to false.      |

## Example

```json
{
  "type": "exercise",
  "title": "Grid Area Practice",
  "widget": "math.grid-area",
  "config": {
    "description": "Highlight 6 cells to show an area of 6 square units.",
    "rows": 5,
    "cols": 5,
    "mode": "area",
    "maxHighlights": 25,
    "showCount": true,
    "interactive": true
  }
}
```

## Tips

- Keep grids under 10×10 for visual clarity
- Use maxHighlights to limit selections when targeting a specific area
- Explain that each square is one square unit
- Show both the rows × columns formula and the counting method
